      <ol>
        <li>The first step to homemade samosa is to cook the potatoes and peas for the filling.To cook the potatoes and peas in a stovetop pressure cooker: Place 3 medium-sized whole potatoes (300 to 450 grams) and 2 to 2.5 cups water in a 3 or 4 litre pressure cooker. On top of the potatoes carefully set a small trivet and pressure cooker-safe bowl with ½ cup green peas. Pressure cook for 5 to 6 whistles or 7 to 8 minutes on medium to medium-high flame.</li>
        <li>If using an Instant Pot: Place 3 medium-sized whole potatoes in the steel insert of a 6 quart IP. Add 2 cups water. Place a trivet on top of the potatoes, and on top of the trivet set a bowl with ½ cup of green peas. Pressure cook on high for 20 to 25 minutes</li>
        <li>For the stovetop pressure cooker, remove the lid after all the pressure falls in the cooker. For the Instant Pot, do a quick pressure release after 5 to 7 minutes. Check with a knife or fork to see if the potatoes are cooked well.The knife or fork should be able to slide through easily if the potatoes are cooked properly.</li>
        <li>If the potatoes are undercooked, then cook them for a few more minutes using the pressure cook function. Once done, drain the potatoes and peas in a colander and set aside to cool.</li>

      <ol>
        <li>Next, roast or toast the spices. This will help to release their flavors and should not be skipped!To a small frying pan over low heat add the following spices:</li>
        <li>½ inch cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>1 clove, optional</li>
        <li>1 green cardamom</li>
        <li>3 black peppercorns</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons coriander seeds</li>
        <li>Heat the spices for just a few minutes until aromatic, being careful to not burn.Indian spices in a skillet being roasted.Remove the spices from the heat and allow to cool completely. Then, put them in a spice grinder or small mixer-grinder jar.</li>
        <li>Grind the toasted spices to a semi-fine powder, and set aside.Mix 2 teaspoons ground coriander (coriander powder), ½ teaspoon ground cumin (cumin powder), ½ teaspoon ground fennel (fennel powder) and ½ teaspoon garam masala powder in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Add this prepared spice mix at step 9 when the green peas and remaining ground spices are added.</li>

      <ol>
        <li>In a small skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil. When the oil becomes medium hot then reduce the heat to low.Crackle ½ teaspoon cumin seeds until fragrant. I used mustard oil as it really adds a punch in the stuffing.</li>
        <li>You can use neutral oil like sunflower oil, safflower oil, grapeseed oil or canola oil.</li>
        <li>hot oil and cumin getting crackled in it in a frying pan.Keep the heat on low and add 1 teaspoon finely chopped or minced ginger and 2 teaspoons finely chopped green chillies. Sauté for a few seconds until the raw aroma of ginger goes away.</li>
        <li>hot oil with cumin seeds, ginger, and green chillies getting fried. Now you can switch off the flame or keep flame to a low. Then add the cooked green peas, ½ teaspoon red chilli powder, 1 pinch of asafoetida (hing), the dry ground spice mix that we made and 1 to 2 teaspoons dry mango powder (amchur).</li>
        <li>The mango powder is what gives the punjabi samosa filling its signature tangy flavor that balances so well with the savory, spicy flavors of the other stuffing ingredients.</li>
        <li>green peas, spice powders added in the pan10. Stir together and sauté for a minute. You can add less or more dry mango powder depending upon personal taste. I added 2 teaspoons as just 1 teaspoon was not quite enough sour flavor for me.</li>
        <li>spices and peas mixed very well11. Next add potato cubes, salt as required and 1 tablespoon chopped coriander leaves (also known as cilantro) to the skillet.</li>
        <li>potatoes, salt and coriander leaves added.Mix very well and sauté for a minute. Check the taste, and add more of the spices, salt or dry mango powder if needed. Cover and set the filling aside while you make the dough.</li>

        <li>The final step to making the best samosa is to fry them to a perfectly crisp golden brown.Use any neutral flavored oil to deep fry – sunflower oil, canola oil, vegetable oil, safflower oil, grapeseed oil are some options.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. Test the oil by adding a small piece of dough – it should come up quickly if the oil is hot enough for frying.Once the oil becomes hot, gently slide 3 to 4 of the prepared stuffed punjabi samosa into the oil, and then immediately reduce the flame to low.</li>
